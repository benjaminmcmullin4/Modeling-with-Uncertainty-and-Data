# Modeling-with-Uncertainty-and-Data
Applied and Computational Mathematics Computer Programming Labs - Volume 3

This GitHub repository encapsulates my journey of learning and implementing probabilistic models primarily using Python. It serves as a testament to my exploration of fundamental concepts in probability, statistical modeling, and machine learning within the context of ACME Volume 3. The code and documentation in this repository represent my efforts to gain practical experience in data analysis, model building, and interpretation of results.

Throughout this project, I delved into various topics such as discrete and continuous probability distributions, Markov processes, classical inference methods, regression techniques, and machine learning algorithms. By translating these concepts into code, I aimed to solidify my understanding and sharpen my skills in Python programming and data science.

This project also reflects my commitment to delivering quality software solutions, as evidenced by the organization of code, thorough documentation, and adherence to best practices in software development. It culminates in a comprehensive exploration of probabilistic models, statistical techniques, and machine learning algorithms applied to real-world datasets.

As part of ACME Volume 3, this project serves as an essential component of my learning journey, showcasing my proficiency in software development, data analysis, and Python programming. It represents the culmination of my efforts in understanding and applying probabilistic models to solve complex problems in various domains.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository to gain insights into my journey of learning and applying probabilistic models using Python. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.
